### Reflection 🤔
In *Programming Technique I* this semester, my learning started with basic fundamentals in the SECJ1013 C++ program: solving, control structures, functions, array, and pointers. It contributed to my learning process with further improvement in logical thinking, usage of time, and cooperation in team projects. Initially, debugging was somehow a challenge as well as keeping to structured programming; it later improved my self-confidence through continual practice. The addition of increased lab support, more comprehensive and integrated projects, and thorough feedback on assignments would greatly improve this class and effectively address any specific learning gaps. This will provide a much richer learning environment and one that is supportive.
